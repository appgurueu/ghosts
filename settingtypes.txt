# Whether to always resize textures to the given fallback dimensions. Guarantees support for arbitrary resolution texture packs. If this is not set, texture packs with a resolution lower than the server texture resolution won't work at all; texture packs with a multiple of said resolution will work well, however. A resolution of 64x64 or lower is usually acceptable performance-wise.
